/* Used to execute a given CGI program in a separate process. Uses the
   version parameter to build the HTTP header. Other parameters are used
   for the FULL implementation only as follows:

     if method is "GET":
       Use query as the value of the QUERY_STRING environment variable.

     if method is "POST":
       Use boundary to split the body of the request (see the project
       page for an example). The size parameter is only used if the POST
       request is for uploading a file, and is the size of the data to
       be uploaded.

  // environment variables:
  //
  //   char *env[] = { "db=foo.txt", "record=2", NULL };
